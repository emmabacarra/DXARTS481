      "Description for posting 3: We’ve got 3 rooms opening up in an 8 person group house located in the Miller Park neighborhood between Cap Hill and the Central District. It’s dope people and a funky house! The house was once part of a work release program and the architecture is fairly institutional. The landlord plans to tear it down and develop apartments eventually. It’s gotten pushed back a few times, but we think this year (til Feb 2026) is probably the last. In the meantime, we took it over and created a group house that is pleasant with lots of living space in one of the most central neighborhoods in Seattle. There's tons of grocery stores, food co-op, etc, as well as several bus lines and the light rail within walking distance. In addition to the 8 bedrooms and three 0.75 bathrooms plus two 0.5 bathrooms, we have a large basement, a living room, dining room, office space, guest room, sheltered backyard, a place for bike storage, and in-unit laundry in the basement. The vibe is somewhere between quirky and punk, with lots of writing and art on the walls.\n",
      "The rooms: Three rooms are available. All are small to medium sized, with rents between $300-$400. Pictures attached.\n",
      "About us: We are a group of friends in our twenties and thirties: most of us know each other through work, previous group houses, and community organizing of multiple kinds. We have one cat in the house. The house is not open to large pets (cats, dogs), sorry! Community is important to us, whether in the house or out of it, and there’s friends over fairly often. There are occasional parties, some smaller, some larger.\n",
      "What we are looking for: We all enjoy spending time together, have good relationships with each other, have biweekly house meetings, occasionally cook meals together, invite friends over, and are all involved in creating and maintaining the space. We are looking for roommates who have some experience living with other people, are good communicators, can commit to a regular chore schedule and biweekly meetings, and who are interested in having relationships with their housemates, and taking care of the space.\n",
      "Accessibility and transit: The house has steps to get up to the entrance. Stairs to go down to the basement. We’re a 15 minute walk to the light rail, and close to multiple bus lines, including. There is free street parking and 3-4 parking spots in the driveway.\n",
      "Drug & alcohol: We have alcohol and marijuana in the house, tobacco smoking outside only.\n",

Despite all the ammenities, the house is modest, a typical late-60's/early-70's split entry home (sometimes called a \"raised ranch\" style) with an addition on the back which added quite a bit of space.  It is roomy and comfortable, but the kitch is kind of old and the house is not fancy or showy.  Still, it has good energy and people seem to like being here.  There is a rowing machine and a treadmill that would love to be used. :)\n",

      "I have been renting out rooms in my house for the past 17 years, and this is the most vacancy I think I've ever had, as our tennents are generally pretty happy and don't leave very often.  The 40yo male has been with me for about 13 years, the woman who is moving out now has been with us for six years, and the last two to move out, who were also women, both left to cohabitate with their partners.  I think they had been here for 3 and 5 years, which is about average for our housemates.  Some have even returned to live here more than once. \n",
      "My philosophy is that to achieve the healthy, happy, harmonious home I want, the best way to do this is to create an environment where people feel right at home, like visiting your own families home.  Where people can thrive because they feel safe, supported, and at ease.  Where you come home and notice your exhale and the tension releasing, as you enter the door.

There is a rowing machine and a treadmill that would love to be used. :)\n",

      "ACCESS INFO: The place is a low fragrance, second floor unit, with a full set of stairs in front, and a back entrance that has three short stairs. The bldg shares one no-cost washer/dryer set that's in the basement, down a full set of outdoor concrete stairs with railing. The laundry room is not low-fragrance.  I use the bus—C Line, 22 and 128 bus access are all within a few blocks. The house is on a relatively steep grade from California, but there is an off-street parking lot that is level and paved in the back with an available parking space for our unit.\n",

Decoration is street signs, globes, and art by former roommates/friends. Think clutter core. We are mostly a house of night owls with some early risers. We are super laid back and peace loving. Except for white nationalists, bigots and anti-vaxxers. We play loud music and throw the occasional party. Many of us are active in the local electronic music scene so we’ll sometimes host afters that go on until the morning. We also like to have friends over to make art, play games and meet new people. We enjoy video games, card games, and board games. We have a backyard with space for a garden and fire pit. We have 1 dog (who is leaving with the outgoing roommate) and 2 indoor cats and we're fostering 1 more indoor cat. We would not be opposed to more animals as long as they get along.\n",
